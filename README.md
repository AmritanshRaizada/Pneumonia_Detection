## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project.
This project provides a user-friendly web interface for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It utilizes a powerful deep learning model based on the VGG16 architecture, which has been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on a specific chest X-ray dataset.

The goal is to offer a fast, accessible, and accurate tool to assist in the preliminary diagnosis of pneumonia, serving as a valuable second opinion for medical professionals and a learning tool for students.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.
You will need Python 3.9+ and `pip` installed on your system.

```
Give examples
```
### Installing

### Installing
Follow these steps to get your development environment running:

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.
1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git
    cd Pneumonia-detection-main
    ```

Say what the step will be
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment**
    ```sh
    # Create the virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

```
Give the example
```
    # Activate it (Windows)
    venv\Scripts\activate

And repeat
    # Activate it (macOS/Linux)
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

```
until finished
```
3.  **Install the required dependencies**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Once the installation is complete, you can run the web application:

1.  **Start the Flask server**
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

2.  **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

3.  **Upload a chest X-ray image** using the form and click "Analyze X-ray" to see the prediction.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.
The project includes a simple script `chest_xray/Test.py` to test the model prediction on a single, hardcoded image directly from the command line.

### Break down into end to end tests
To run the test, execute the following command from the project's root directory:
```sh
python chest_xray/Test.py
```
It will load the `our_model.h5` and print the prediction result in the console.

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
This application is configured for easy deployment to cloud platforms like Render or Heroku.

-   **`Procfile`**: Tells the hosting service how to start the application using the `gunicorn` WSGI server.
-   **`runtime.txt`**: Specifies the Python version to be used on the server.
-   **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all necessary Python packages for the deployment environment.

To deploy, connect your GitHub repository to a web service on your chosen platform, and it will use these files to build and run the application automatically.
